# First_visualisation_COVID-19
Hello github community. 
This is my very first visualisation project. 
I've used Python libraries to track how COVID-19 has spread across the world over the last few months.
It is a small victory for me and I decided what better way to celebrate that than post it on github.
The dataset is available on Kaggle.
